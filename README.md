# Song-Recommendation-System


## Overview

This Google Colab notebook explores and clusters music data based on audio features using Spotify API. Additionally, it recommends songs based on a given list of user-inputted songs. The key steps include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature correlations and song count per decade.
2. **Clustering:** Employing KMeans for clustering genres and visualizing them using t-SNE and PCA.
3. **Song Recommendation:** Utilizing Spotify API to find and recommend similar songs.

**Changing Data File Location**
By default, the notebook assumes the music dataset is located in the music_data folder in your Google Drive. If your data is in a different location, update the file path accordingly whereever you have stored in your google drive

### Prerequisites
Open the Google Colab notebook.
Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with your Spotify API credentials.
Run the notebook cells sequentially.
